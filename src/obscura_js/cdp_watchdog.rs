//! Shared per-command V8 watchdog for the CDP server.
//!
//! The CDP dispatcher holds a process-wide V8 lock around every V8-touching
//! command, so at most one command's isolate is ever executing at a time. That
//! lets a single long-lived watchdog thread bound the current command with a
//! deadline, instead of spawning+joining a thread per command (which adds
//! ~240us per command on the hot dispatch path). `arm` and `disarm` are just a
//! mutex + condvar notify, in the low microseconds.
//!
//! Correctness rests on the V8-lock serialization: between `arm` and `disarm`
//! the caller holds the V8 lock, so no other command can arm, and the single
//! slot is exclusively this command's.
